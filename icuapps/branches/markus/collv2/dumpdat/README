Not a lot to write home about yet. Good way to debug the versions of
your data files. Example use:

# ./dumpdat dat unames
isAcceptable() called on:
Size: 20, Endianness: l, Charset family: A, UChar=2 bytes.
dataFormat   =117.110. 97.109 unam
formatVersion=  1.  0.  0.  0 ____
dataVersion  =  3.  0.  0.  0 ____

Size: 20, Endianness: l, Charset family: A, UChar=2 bytes.
dataFormat   =117.110. 97.109 unam
formatVersion=  1.  0.  0.  0 ____
dataVersion  =  3.  0.  0.  0 ____


The first header is the one passed to isAcceptable() [which always
returns TRUE]. The second is the one that's actually returned.

Future versions of dumpdat could actually dump out the contents of a
data file, or perhaps extract them into a new file. [In this way one
could de-commonize a DLL or .dat file].

Ideas? Suggestions? better yet, improve this and send us the patch!
