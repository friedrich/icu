Translit-o-matic, by Steven R. Loomis, based on the Java version by
    Mark Davis. First shown publicly at IUC16, Amsterdam, March 2000
       

What it does:

 - CGI which creates a frame with the source document on the left,
        and a transliterated version on the right.

Depends on:

 - htmlent transliterator, really wants the other demo transliterators
        installed (see xtradata)

Shows:

 - Transliteration framework

To use it:

 - #define DOCPATH to a directory with UTF-8 encoded html documents
 - #define DOCURL as the URL root for the same files
 - Place 'xlitomatic' in your CGI-BIN and run it.

TODO:

 - URL network fetch is nonfunctional
 - Handle other encodings besides utf-8
 - Better handling of html escaped entities?
 - Clean-up code & interface.
 - Localize.

Notes on the wraparound buffer: [urlsource.cpp]
------------------------------
#=10
R- first byte to read from. W - after last 

0123456789
R.........
W.........       0 bytes in buffer
                since w>=r, W-R=0


R......... 0
.........W 9     9 bytes in buffer.
XXXXXXXXX      ((w+1)%n) = 0 = R, FULL

                since W>=R,  W-R=9


......R... 6
..W....... 2
XX    XXXX    6 bytes in buffer. 
                  since r>w:  (n-r)+(w) = 4+2 = 6

if(R>W)
   copy 'n-R' bytes@R
then copy W bytes@0
