simple cgi to browse the unicode codespace

todo:
* turn on RADICAL_LIST  [needs other data]
* docs
* prettify
* rewrite to use USTDIO!!
* better interface for choosing encoding

----

installation:

* make sure udata and locexp are built and installed. Best to
  run 'make install' from the icuapps directory.

  Depends on:  liblxutil, libudata, unames binary file (unames.dat)

* put ubrowse in the cgi-bin, etc directory.

* Usage:

   If the path to the cgi is 'http://www.foo.blah/cgi-bin/ubrowse', then 
   for instance you can go to the path:

      http://www.foo.blah/cgi-bin/ubrowse/iso-8859-6/

   to view it in the Latin-6 codepage. Default is Latin-1.


   The first page you come to has a link for every 256 code points. 
  Click on one to view it.

   Secondly, you come to rows of characters, 16 per row. 
  [this is designed to look like the Unicode book].
   Click on the HEADING of a row to view that row in more detail.

   Thirdly you will be presented with detailed information for each
  character.

   You can search for a specific script or type by using the appropriate
 popup menus, or jump to a particular code point.

   Text in green has been decomposed using the fallback interator.
