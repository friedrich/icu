 If you have an application that is written using the ICU that you
would like to contribute, join the ICU mailing list [above URL] and
contact us.


BUILDING
--------


*** UNIX (or other command line platforms):

  1. Build and install the ICU ('make install'). Make note of the 
      prefix used to build the ICU, which can be set with the
     '--prefix=' option to it's ./configure.

  2. (Run 'autoconf' if there is no configure script.)
     Run the ./configure script in the icuapps directory.  You may need
     to supply the same '--prefix=XXX' argument that was passed to the
     ICU.

  3. Type 'make' in the icuapps, or 'make install' if you wish.

 Example:

  ICU:
     cd ...somewhere/icu
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make install
  
  ICUAPPS:
     cd ...somewhere/icuapps         (THIS directory)
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make
     make install                    (optional)



*** Win32 Instructions
  
  1. Project files to be created. 
  2. For now, you may create your own project file and include
     the ICU include and lib directories.

THE APPS


- uconv    From : Jonas Utterstrom 
                  <jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se>
           Uses : Conversion

   This program will convert data file(s) from one encoding to another
   via Unicode.
   
   As of ICU 1.9, this program is now part of the main ICU build. Though
   it is still not supported it is more convenient there.

- usort    From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Collation

   There are two parts here.

    * a shared library (libusort) which makes it simple to sort lines
      of text.

    * a command line example program (usort) which will sort lines
      from the console or the file, similar to UNIX 'sort'. 

- locexp   From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Collation, Chartypes, Formatting,
                  Resource Bundles,  ...
                  uconv & usort [above]

    * Shows off a lot of things. go to the ICU homepage and
       look for the Locale Explorer.

- ubrowse   From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Chartypes..
                  Depends on locexp/util.

    * Browse the Unicode UCS-2 code space.


- dumpdat     From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : UData

    * A way to look at the version and info headers on a udata
      file


- udata    *** OBSOLETE - now part of udata [part of the ICU]

- xlitomatic From: Steven R. Loomis
                   <srl [at] icu-project.org>
        
           Uses: transliteration
                 Depends on: locexp/util, etc.

     * Transliterates HTML files using any transliterator. C++.
 
- calexpo   From: Steven R. Loomis        [NOT CHECKED IN]
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses: Date/Time formatting, Calendar

     * Demonstrates the flexibility of the Calendar class.
