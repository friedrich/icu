This package contains the tool to generate the data library.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
--------------------
Keep ICU and ICUAPPS in the same directory 
	
	cd ....somewhere/datacustom/work/icu
	ICU will be installed in ......somewhere/datacustom
	cd ....somewhere/datacustom/work/icuapps
	
	
BUILDING
--------

Read the README file of ICUAPPS to build and install ICU and ICUAPPS
 
 Example:

  ICU:
     cd ....somewhere/datacustom/work/icu
     ./configure --prefix=......somewhere/datacustom
     make install
  
  ICUAPPS:
     cd ....somewhere/datacustom/work/icuapps        (THIS directory)
     ./configure --prefix=....somewhere/datacustom/
     make install                    (optional)


DATA
----

Checkout the .ucm file from 

	http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/charset/data/ucm/
	http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/data/trunk/charset/contrib/data/ucm/

Merge these files into the data/mappings directory of
ICU(...somewhere/datacustom/work/icu/source/data/mappings).

DO NOT REPLACE THE EXISTING FILES UNDER DATA/MAPPING DIRECTORY WHILE MERGING. JUST ADD
THE MISSING FILES


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
--------------------

Make sure that your PATH,LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CATALINA_HOME and CLASSPATH are all set correctly while 
building data on the local machine.


RUNNING DATA CUSTOMIZER
-----------------------

Before running this tool make sure that you have setup your environment as described 
above.

	cd ........somewhere/datacustom/work/icuapps/datacustom
	make  
	ant war
	
This will generate the .dat file under icuapps/datacustom/gendatadep and the 
datacustom.war file under icuapps/datacustom. The name of the .dat file will depend
on the version of ICU. For example if the version is 4.0 the name of the file will be
icudt40l.dat,for 3.8 it will be icudt38l.dat, etc. 


UPDATING SERVER DATA
--------------------

The ICU tool needs to be built on the server too inorder to get the new icupkg and genrb tools. On the
server keep and build the ICU source code under ~/icu-src and installed it in ~/icu.

Extract all the data file from icudt40l.dat on the local machine, zip all these files and move it on to
the server. Unzip these data files under ~/datacustom/source/icudt40l on the server. 

Install datacustom.war on the server. You may need to restart the tomcat to see the changes.
