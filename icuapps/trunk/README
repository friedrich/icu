 This package contains sample applications built using the ICU. For

 If you have an application that is written using the ICU that you
would like to contribute, see the contact information above.


BUILDING
--------


*** UNIX (or other command line platforms):

  1. Build and install the ICU ('make install'). Make note of the 
      prefix used to build the ICU, which can be set with the
     '--prefix=' option to it's ./configure.

  2. (Run 'autoconf' if there is no configure script.)
     Run the ./configure script in the icuapps directory.  You may need
     to supply the same '--prefix=XXX' argument that was passed to the
     ICU.

  3. Type 'make' in the icuapps, or 'make install' if you wish.

 Example:

  ICU:
     cd ...somewhere/icu
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make install
  
  ICUAPPS:
     cd ...somewhere/icuapps         (THIS directory)
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make
     make install                    (optional)



*** Win32 Instructions
  
  1. Project files to be created. 
  2. For now, you may create your own project file and include
     the ICU include and lib directories.
