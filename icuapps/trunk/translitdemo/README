Transliterator Demo README

The Transliterator demo program is a simple CGI that allows the user
to transliterate text to and from various scripts using system
transliterators built into ICU.  It is designed to work with ICU4c
version 1.8 or later.

OSS setup
---------

On OSS we are going to map the URL
  http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/translitdemo
to
  /www/software10/cgi-bin/icu/translitdemo

This is a shell script that sets LD_LIBARARY_PATH and ICU_DATA
appropriately and invokes the actual binary.

Installation
------------

translit: The CGI executable is assumed to live in a cgi-bin directory
(e.g., /home/httpd/cgi-bin/translit for an Apache default
installation).
- This location is specified in translit_template.html
                            and translit_rule_edit.html

translit_template.html: This data file is read by the CGI executable.
The CGI expects it to be at the relative location (to the cgi) of
data/translit_template.html.
- This location is specified in TransliteratorCGI.cpp

Library path: To let the CGI see the ICU shared libraries, set the
library path.  One way is to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./translit
will invoke the CGI from the command line, if one is in the cgi-bin
directory, and the ICU libraries (e.g. libicuuc.so.18) are in
/usr/local/lib.
  Another way on Linux is to add the line
  /usr/local/lib
  to the file /etc/ld.so.conf, then run /sbin/ldconfig (as root).
