-------------------------

These are additional files that MAY be dropped into your installed ICU
data directory.   They are used by the locale explorer.

 In addition, there are a few new locales thrown in here. They are to
be considered in 'draft' stage. Please give them a try!  You can add
them to your index.txt [the ICU one, not the one in the locexp
directory] if you want them to show up in the locale explorer's list.
Consider these a bonus:

    mt.txt  mt_MT.txt  :  Maltese langauge locales.
	eo.txt	 - esperanto
	hi*.txt  - Hindi  [very experimental]

do 'make' to get full instructions of what to do with this dir.

Basically:

	fetchOrigFiles /path/to/icu/data/        (path to the build dir)

	make install-all


-------------------------

this is a new build step, any feedback would be appreciated! thanks.
