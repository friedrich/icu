<h4><b><i>Instructions:</i></b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Type in the lines of text you want to sort under <b>Input Text</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the <i>Options</i> you want, and hit <b>Sort</b>.</li>
  <li>The two output columns will show the original order and the sorted order,
    each numbered according to the original line. Any lines in the same box
    (with the same color) are sorted identically, according to the options you
    provide.</li>
  <li>If you want to try changing the sorting rules, hit <b>Edit Rules</b>. It
    inserts the rules for the current locale, which you can then alter and try
    sorting with. You will need to know the format of the rules: see <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/Collate_Intro.html">Collation</a>
    in the ICU User Guide for more information.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Note:</b> if you hit <b>Edit Rules</b> again, it will replace
        whatever you have altered!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><i><b>Options:</b></i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>ICU implements the Unicode Collation Algorithm, which is a multi-level
    sort.
    <ol>
      <li>If there are any differences in base letters, that determines the
        result</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if there are any differences in accents*, that determines
        the results</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if there are any differences in case*, that determines the
        results</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if there are any differences in punctuation*, that
        determines the results</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Level</i> option determines which of the above levels to take into
    account when sorting.</li>
  <li>With <i>Force Case</i>, the normal case order (a &lt; A vs. A &lt; a) can
    be changed.</li>
  <li>If <i>Punctutation = Base</i>, then punctuation is treated like base
    letters. If punctuation is <i>Shifted</i>, it is ignored except at L4.</li>
  <li>A <i>Case</i> level can be used to keep a case level even if the strength
    is L1 or L2.</li>
  <li>A <i>Hiragana</i> level adds a special level for JIS compatibility. It is
    only used if the level is L4 .. L5.</li>
  <li><i>French</i> accents force accents to be considered backwards, for the
    end of the string forwards.</li>
  <li>With <i>Full Normalization</i>, all strings are compared</li>
</ul>
