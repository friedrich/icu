Note:
 These samples now use "u_printf" which was added in ICU 49.   You can get equivalent
behavior on older ICUs with:
  UFILE *out = u_finit(stdout, loc, NULL);
  u_fprintf(out, "\n\nlocale=%s\n", loc);
  ...
  u_fclose(out);

----


Windows Visual Studio: 

Use the project file iucsamples.sln.  
Set  variable IcuDir  to the root of your ICU build (containing bin, lib, include)
set PATH=%IcuDir%\bin;%PATH% 


UNIXes: see below.


To locate ICU for the purpose of these samples, ensure one of the following is true:

1. ICU built, not installed:
      Set the variable "icubuild" to point to a built ICU source directory (in-source or out of source)
   Example:  add to 'local.mk' this line:    "icubuild=/home/srl/icu/source" being a directory where ICU is built.
   Example:  'export icubuild=/tmp/icu-build'  

2. ICU built, installed, pkg-config is installed:
     (PKG_CONFIG_PATH or equivalent should point to icu's .pc files).

3. ICU built, installed, icu-config is on the $PATH

Note:
 Make sure icu's bin and sbin dirs are on the PATH.
 You may want to set [DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include icu's lib dir also.

To build and run all samples, just run 'make check'. To build an individual sample, run 'make check' from inside that directory.

The "icurun" script can also be used to build individual files. See
  http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tools/trunk/scripts/icurun
