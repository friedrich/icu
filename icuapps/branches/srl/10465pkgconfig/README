 This package contains sample applications built using the ICU. For
more information on the ICU:

 URL:   http://icu-project.org/

 If you have an application that is written using the ICU that you
would like to contribute, join the ICU mailing list [above URL] and
contact us.


BUILDING
--------


*** UNIX (or other command line platforms):

  1. Build and install the ICU ('make install'). Make note of the
      prefix used to build the ICU, which can be set with the
     '--prefix=' option to it's ./configure.
     (or: install ICU via your favorite packaging utility.)

  2. icuapps will locate ICU by one of three ways:
      #1 the --with-icu= parameter passed to configure
      #2 by locating the .pc (pkg-config) files
      #3 by locating the icu-config shell script

  3. Run the ./configure script in the icuapps directory.
You may want to supply a --prefix argument.

  4. Type 'make' in the icuapps, or 'make install' if you wish.

 Example:

  ICU:
     cd ...somewhere/icu
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make install

  ICUAPPS:
     cd ...somewhere/icuapps         (THIS directory)
     ./configure --prefix=/var/local
     make
     make install                    (optional)

*** Windows build may be broken as of this writing!
*** Windows Instructions
  1. build ICU in an 'icu' directory
  2. build icuapps in an 'icuapps' directory at the same level as 'icu'

RUNNING CGIS
------------

  Windows systems:
    Put the CGIs  and ICU DLLs in the CGI-BIN directory.

  UNIX type systems:
    You will need to make sure ICU libraries are on the path, if ICU was not built statically.
    One option is to populate the cgi-bin directory with 'wrapper' scripts.  Create copies or
    symlinks of this script with the name of the cgis (locexp, ubrowse, etc).  Change the 'ICU'
    variable to point at the base of the installed ICU. (the prefix).

----------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# wrapper script.

ME=`basename $0`
ICU=/installed/icu
cd ${ICU}/bin
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ICU}/lib:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
exec ${ICU}/bin/${ME}

THE APPS


- uconv    From : Jonas Utterstrom
                  <jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se>
           Uses : Conversion

   This program will convert data file(s) from one encoding to another
   via Unicode.

   As of ICU 1.9, this program is now part of the main ICU build. Though
   it is still not supported it is more convenient there.

- usort    From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Collation

   There are two parts here.

    * a shared library (libusort) which makes it simple to sort lines
      of text.

    * a command line example program (usort) which will sort lines
      from the console or the file, similar to UNIX 'sort'.

- locexp   From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Collation, Chartypes, Formatting,
                  Resource Bundles,  ...
                  uconv & usort [above]

    * Shows off a lot of things. go to the ICU homepage and
       look for the Locale Explorer.

- ubrowse   From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : Conversion, Chartypes..
                  Depends on locexp/util.

    * Browse the Unicode UCS-2 code space.


- dumpdat     From : Steven R. Loomis
                  <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses : UData

    * A way to look at the version and info headers on a udata
      file

- xlitomatic From: Steven R. Loomis
                   <srl [at] icu-project.org>

           Uses: transliteration
                 Depends on: locexp/util, etc.

     * Transliterates HTML files using any transliterator. C++.
