<h1 align="left">Transliteration</h1>
<p>Transliteration is the general process of converting characters from one 
script to another, such as converting from Greek to Latin, or Japanese katakana 
to Latin. It is very important to note that this transliteration is <b><i>not</i></b> 
translation; it is simply converting the letters from one script to another, <i>not</i> 
translating the underlying words. Here is a sample of transliteration:</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">Source</th>
    <th width="50%">Transliteration to Latin</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">キャンパス</td>
    <td width="50%" align="center">kyanpasu</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">Αλφαβητικός Κατάλογος</td>
    <td width="50%" align="center">Alphabêtikós Katálogos</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">биологическом</td>
    <td width="50%" align="center">biologichjeskom</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>While it may be a stretch to realize that <i>kyanpasu</i> is equivalent to 
the English word <i>campus</i>, someone without any knowledge of Japanese will 
have a far easier time recognizing and interpreting the text than if the letters 
were left in the original script. This is especially useful in particular 
instances. For example, when viewing user names that are entered in a world-wide 
database, it is extremely helpful to be able to view and refer to them in one's 
native script. It is also useful for product support; if a service engineer is 
sent a program dump filled with characters from foreign scripts, it can be much 
easier to diagnose the problem when the text is transliterated and the 
characters are recognizable. When doing searching and indexing, it also allows 
for retrieval of information in a different script.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There are many different possible transliterations between scripts. The 
    preliminary ICU transliterations are designed to capture all of the 
    distinctions made in the source script, and be as language-neutral as 
    possible. ICU makes it easy to design and add additional, language-specific 
    transliterations as well.</li>
  <li>These transliterations follow the Japanese convention of using a single 
    quote to disambiguate possible digraphs. For example, for Greek to Latin, <i>ψ</i> 
    maps to <i>ps</i> while <i>πσ</i> maps to <i>p's.</i></li>
  <li>They also follow the convention that a tilde is used for variant forms.</li>
  <li>If you have any feedback on these transliterations, you can file bugs 
    and/or feature requests with <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/bugs">jitterbug</a>.</li>
