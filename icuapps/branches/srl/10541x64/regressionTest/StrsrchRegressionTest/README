StrsrchRegressionTest
---------------------

This program is use to test string search results in ICU between different versions of ICU.
Currently, there is only a c version of this program.

Given a text file in Unicode codepoints, this program will cycle through all the available
locales and specific collator settings and report the results into a text file.

The program will search for a pattern, which is the first line of the text file, in the text
file.

After the test has been ran, you can run the parsing script over the results to determine
if there are any differences in collation key between different versions of ICU.


Note: You can also use this test to test against different string search implementation
(e.g. linear vs. Boyer-Moore)

Files:

parseStrsrchResults.pl--------Perl script to parse the results.
c/
c/strsrchRegressionTest.cpp---Program to run on ICU4C.

Sample usage:
After successfully compiling the program in c, run
./strsrchRegressionTest -d result_dir -f text_file

After running the test, you can parse the results with the following command
./parseStrsrchResults.pl result_dir result_log
