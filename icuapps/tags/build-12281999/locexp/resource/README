 So you want to translate locale explorer? Cool :)

 Run the build process, and then snag yourself a copy of default.txt as
it is produced. Rename it's filename to something (i.e. it.txt for
italian) and rename 'default' to 'it' inside.

 At this point, it's probably best if you could use any editor to
write the text, but then email it to me [with the encoding you used to
save a PLAIN text file]:  srl@monkey.sbay.org

 Or write me and ask me how it's done.
