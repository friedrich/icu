Transliterator Demo README

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE
This README is badly out of date.  It does not reflect:
- The state of the world after the 08/2001 OSS server relocation.
- New information about running the CGI locally on a Win2K/WinNT machine
  running Apache Win32.
Expect an update (or write one, if you can!) Real Soon Now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transliterator demo program is a simple CGI that allows the user
to transliterate text to and from various scripts using system
transliterators built into ICU.  It is designed to work with ICU4c
version 1.8 or later.

OSS setup
---------

On OSS we are going to map the URL
  http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/translitdemo
to
  /www/software10/cgi-bin/icu/translitdemo

This is a shell script that sets LD_LIBARARY_PATH and ICU_DATA
appropriately and invokes the actual binary.

Installation
------------

translit: The CGI executable is assumed to live in a cgi-bin directory
(e.g., /home/httpd/cgi-bin/translit for an Apache default
installation).
- This location is specified in translit_template.html
                            and translit_rule_edit.html

translit_template.html: This data file is read by the CGI executable.
The CGI expects it to be at the relative location (to the cgi) of
data/translit_template.html.
- This location is specified in TransliteratorCGI.cpp

translit_rule_edit.html: Same.

util.js: This will be loaded using a <SCRIPT SRC="..."> tag.  The CGI
expects it at "../js/util.js".  On Apache this maps to
/home/httpd/html/js/util.js in the standard configuration.  On Apache
this file must not be under the cgi-bin directory, or the server will
try to execute it.

Library path: To let the CGI see the ICU shared libraries, set the
library path.  One way is to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./translit
will invoke the CGI from the command line, if one is in the cgi-bin
directory, and the ICU libraries (e.g. libicuuc.so.18) are in
/usr/local/lib.
  Another way on Linux is to add the line
  /usr/local/lib
  to the file /etc/ld.so.conf, then run /sbin/ldconfig (as root).

Permissions
-----------

The CGI wants to write to the file system.  To make this possible,
the directory cgi-bin/data/ must have world-writable permissions.
There may be a more secure way to do this also.

HTTP Server
-----------

Update: The following shouldn't be necessary; Apache should be
set up this way already.

Make sure that the http server is configured for JavaScript (.js)
include files.  In Apache, this means adding the line:

  AddType application/x-javascript .js

to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.  (Then restart the server with
"/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart").
