CollRegressionTest
------------------

This program is use to test collation key in ICU between different versions of ICU.
It was originally written in c and included here is a java port that provides the
same test.

Given a test data file containing various Unicode codepoints, this program will cycle
through all the available locales and all the combinations for a collator and report
the collation key to a text file.

After the test has been ran, you can run the parsing script over the results to determine
if there are any differences in collation key between different versions of ICU or between
ICU4C and ICU4J.

Files:

collRegTest.dat-----------------Test data file containing the actual Unicode codepoints
collRegData.txt-----------------File containing readable value of Unicode codepoints of the test data
parseCollationResults.pl--------Perl script to parse the results
c/
c/collationRegressionTest.cpp---Program to run against ICU4C
j/
j/src/CollationRegTest.java-----Program to run against ICU4J

Sample usage:
After successfully compiling the program in c, run
./collationRegressionTest -d result_dir -f collRegTest.dat

You should use the same result directory for each version of ICU you are running this test
against.

After running the test, you can parse the results with the following command
./parseCollationResults.pl result_dir result_diff.log result_same.log collRegData.txt
