-------------------------

This file describes necessary steps for building and using locale explorer
on Win32 platforms.

Before reading this file, please read README file in the same directory.

BUILDING LOCALE EXPLORER ON WIN32
---------------------------------

Required environment for building locale explorer on Win32 platforms is
the same as for building ICU - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. 

Also, before building locexp, the whole icu system should be built and 
working.

Locexp is automatically built by using using the provided locexp.dsw
work space in this directory, or by using all.dsw workspace in ..\all
directory. 

A copy of locexp.exe file will be made in cgi-bin directory. If your
cgi-bin dir differs from "c:\program files\apache group\apache\cgi-bin"
you will want to change post-build step "install to cgi-bin" so that it
reflects your situation.

When you build locexp, you should get an executable file locexp.exe in
your debug or release directory, depending on the type of build.

Next, you need to build resource files for locexp. Resource files are in
resource directory. They should be built by invoking genrb on each of them.

After creating .res files, make a new directory in icu\data directory and
name it 'locexp'. Copy all the .res files there.


RUNNING LOCALE EXPLORER
-----------------------

Locale explorer is intendended to be run as a CGI-BIN application from
your web server. 

If you don't have the web server readily available, you can still start 
the locexp from command line. However, you need first to set some environment
variables by running testvar.bat from the tools directory. Afterwards, invoke
locexp.exe.

Setting up locexp to work with a web server involves several more steps.

1) Environment variable ICU_DATA should be set to point to icu data directory.
Although it is a requirement for running and building ICU, for some reason web
server do not transfer this environment variable. 

If you are using Apache for Win32 you should add the line:
SetEnv ICU_DATA c:\icu\icu\data\ #or whatever is the path to your icu\data dir
to the end of httpd.conf file.

2) Copy file icudata.dll from icu data directory to any directory on PATH. 
(Good candidates are icu\bin\debug or icu\bin\release).

3) Copy locexp.exe to cgi-bin directory of your web server.

Try locexp by going to http://localhost/cgi-bin/locexp
