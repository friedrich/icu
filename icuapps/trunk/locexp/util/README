locale explorer utils readme

 What can I say.  Anything that seemed too general to go into Locale
Explorer (which itself needs a reorg) has ended up here.

 The most popular exports from here are the callbacks and the FSWF
mechanism.  Please post to our newsgroups or mailing lists if you look
at these and find them useful.  Most of this grew out of internal demo
work.

   * Are these useful API's or new functionality?
   * Are there bugs?
   * Do you have any ideas for new functionality?
   * How are you using these routines in your own programs?

------------

Here's kind of a laundry list of what you may or may not find
contained herein::

kangxi.h    - table of the KangXi radicals

* the C API's that never were [yet]
utimzone.h  - TimeZone       wrapper

* C api additions
ures_additions.h - a couple of functions on resource bundles, and one
                   on number format

* CALLBACKS
collectcb.h   - remembers which characters failed conversion

decompcb.h    - runs text through the Normalizer [as well as some
                special tables] looking for better matches

fontedcb.h    - switches HTML fonts to simulate a real rendering
                pipeline. Includes [incomplete] shaping/rendering
                for Syriac[Assyrian] and Devanagari[Hindi].
                  [ Errors now handled better! Digits now supported! ]
          
translitcb.h  - Runs text through the Transliterator, based on script.
                Supports: Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, and Kana.

* MISCELLANEOUS
lx_utils.h   - a mishmash of:
                    - sorting and traversal of the Locale tree
                    - FSWF - works with extractStrings.sh to provide
                            'mesage catalog' type 
                    - URL/query field escaping and management


* IMPLEMENTATION
syrtables.h   - syriac implementation
fonted_imp.h  - common file for 'fontedcb' modules
devtables.h   - devanagari implementation

TODO:

 - translitcb

    - REALLY want to have a composite converter, etc..
    X But in the meantime:   Transliterate runs of the same BLOCK all as one. Better yet,
      transliterate text that wants the same transliterator, all in
      one run.  That way things like {PHI}{epsilon} can turn into Phe and
      not PHe.  [NB i think this is done..]

   - at least make transliteration locale sensitive
